    <string name="seizure2">A seizure can be caused by many things. These can include:
        \n<b>■</b> An imbalance of nerve-signaling brain chemicals (neurotransmitters)
        \n<b>■</b> Brain tumor
        \n<b>■</b> Stroke
        \n<b>■</b> Brain damage from illness or injury
        \nEpilepsy may be caused by a combination of these. In most cases, the cause of epilepsy can’t be found.</string>

    <string name="seizure3">"Your symptoms depend on the type of seizure. General symptoms or warning signs of a seizure can include:
\n<b>■</b> Staring
\n<b>■</b> Jerking movements of the arms and legs
\n<b>■</b> Stiffening of the body
\n<b>■</b> Loss of consciousness
\n<b>■</b> Breathing problems or stopping breathing
\n<b>■</b> Loss of bowel or bladder control
\n<b>■</b> Falling suddenly for no apparent reason,especially when associated with loss of consciousness
\n<b>■</b> Not responding to noise or words for brief periods

    <string name="earth_para1">An earthquake is a sudden shaking of Earth\'s surface caused by the movement of rocks deep underneath.
        Most quakes are unnoticeable by people on Earth\'s surface. Thousands of quakes occur every day but are too weak to be felt.

    </string>

    <string name="earth_para2"><b>■Plate tectonics</b> - The Earth\’s outermost layer is fragmented into about 15 major slabs called tectonic plates. These slabs form the lithosphere, which is comprised of the crust (continental and oceanic) and the upper part of the mantle. Tectonic plates move very slowly relative to each other, typically a few centimetres per year, but this still causes a huge amount of deformation at the plate boundaries, which in turn results in earthquakes.\n
       \n<b>■Elastic rebound theory</b> - Before an earthquake, the buildup of stress in the rocks on either side of a fault results in gradual deformation. Eventually, this deformation exceeds the frictional force holding the rocks together and sudden slip occurs along the fault. This releases the accumulated stress and the rocks on either side of the fault return to their original shape (elastic rebound) but are offset on either side of the fault.\n

    <string name="flood_para1">Floods are the most frequent type of natural disaster and occur when an overflow of water submerges land that is usually dry. Floods are often caused by heavy rainfall, rapid snow-melt or a storm surge from a tropical cyclone or tsunami in coastal areas.
    </string>

    <string name="flood_para2">A flood can develop in a many ways. The most common is when rivers or streams overflow their banks. These floods are called riverine floods. Heavy rain, a broken dam or levee, rapid ice-melt in the mountains, or even a beaver dam in a vulnerable spot can overwhelm a river and send it spreading over nearby land. The land surrounding a river is called a flood plain.\n\nCoastal flooding, also called estuarine flooding, happens when a large storm or tsunami causes the sea to rush inland.
    </string>
    <string name="flood_para3"><b>To prepare for a flood, you should:</b>\n\n■Avoid building in flood prone areas unless you elevate and reinforce your home.\n■Elevate the furnace, water heater, and electric panel if susceptible to flooding.\n■Install "Check Valves" in sewer traps to prevent floodwater from backing up into the drains of your home.\n■Contact community officials to find out if they are planning to construct barriers (levees, beams and flood walls) to stop floodwater from entering the homes in your area.\n■Seal the walls in your basement with waterproofing compounds to avoid seepage.\n
        <b>\nIf a flood is likely to hit  your area, you should:</b>\n\n■Listen to the radio or television for information.\n■Be aware that flash flooding can occur. If there is any possibility of a flash flood, move immediately to higher ground. Do not wait for instructions to move.\n■Be aware of streams, drainage channels, canyons, and other areas known to flood suddenly. Flash floods can occur in these areas with or without such typical warnings as rain clouds or heavy rain.\n
        <b>\nIf you must prepare to evacuate, you should:</b>\n\n■Secure your home. If you have time, bring in outdoor furniture. Move essential items to an upper floor.\n■Turn off utilities at the main switches or valves if instructed to do so. Disconnect electrical appliances. Do not touch electrical equipment if you are wet or standing in water.\n
        <b>\nIf you have to leave your home, remember these evacuation tips:</b>\n\n■Do not walk through moving water. Six inches of moving water can make you fall. If you have to walk in water, walk where the water is not moving. Use a stick to check the firmness of the ground in front of you.\n■Do not drive into flooded areas. If floodwaters rise around your car, abandon the car and move to higher ground if you can do so safely. You and the vehicle can be quickly swept away.\n</string>

    <string name="bleeding">Bleeding refers to the loss of blood from the circulatory system, typically caused by injury to blood vessels. It can occur internally, where blood leaks from blood vessels inside the body, or externally through a break in the skin or other body openings like the mouth or nose. There are 3 types of bleeding:
    </string>

    <string name="bleeding1">This is the least severe form of bleeding, characterized by slow oozing of blood from small vessels (capillaries). It typically occurs from minor cuts and abrasions. It often stops on its own or with minimal first aid.
    </string>

    <string name="bleeding2">In this type, blood flows steadily and is darker in color due to its lower oxygen content. While it is usually less severe than arterial bleeding, it can still result in significant blood loss if not controlled promptly.
    </string>

    <string name="bleeding3">This is the most severe type of bleeding, where blood spurts out forcefully in rhythm with the heartbeat. The blood is bright red due to its high oxygen content. Arterial bleeding can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention.
    </string>

    <string name="capillaries_bleeding"><b>Clean the wound:</b> Wash the area gently with soap and water to prevent infection.\n<b>Apply a sterile dressing or band-aid:</b> Place a clean bandage or adhesive strip over the wound to protect it.\n<b>Direct pressure (if needed):</b> If the bleeding is slow to stop, apply light pressure to control it.\n<b>Monitor for infection:</b> Capillary bleeding is often minor, but make sure to check for signs of infection like redness or swelling as the wound heals.\n
    </string>

    <string name="venous_bleeding"><b>Direct pressure:</b> Apply firm, consistent pressure with a sterile cloth or bandage.\n<b>Elevate the injury:</b> If the bleeding is from a limb, elevate it above the level of the heart to slow the bleeding.\n<b>Monitor and control bleeding:</b> Continue applying pressure until the bleeding stops. Replace the dressing if it becomes soaked, but try to avoid disturbing the clotting process by lifting the bandage unnecessarily.\n<b>Seek medical attention:</b> If bleeding is profuse or does not stop with pressure, seek medical help.\n
    </string>

    <string name="arterial_bleeding"><b>Immediate pressure:</b> Apply direct, firm pressure to the wound using a sterile cloth or dressing to try and control the bleeding.\n<b>Use a tourniquet:</b> If pressure doesn’t stop the bleeding and it’s on a limb, use a tourniquet above the wound (between the heart and the injury) if trained to do so.\n<b>Call for emergency help:</b> This type of bleeding can be life-threatening, so call for emergency medical services immediately.\n<b>Keep the person calm and lying down:</b> To reduce shock, keep the injured person still and lying flat if possible.\n
    </string>

    <string name="snake_bite">A snakebite occurs when a snake punctures the skin with its fangs, injecting venom in some cases. Snakebites can vary widely in severity, depending on the species of snake, whether venom was injected, and the size or health of the person bitten. There are 2 types of Snake Bites:
    </string>

    <string name="dry_bite">This occurs when a snake strikes but does not inject venom. Although painful and alarming, dry bites generally do not cause significant harm beyond localized pain or minor swelling.
    </string>

    <string name="venomous_bite">These bites involve the injection of venom, which can have various effects depending on the snake\'s species. Venomous snakebites are more dangerous and require immediate medical attention.
    </string>

    <string name="dry_bite1"><b>Stay calm:</b> The bite can still be painful, but there’s no venom to cause serious harm.\n<b>Clean the wound:</b> Use soap and water to clean the bite site to reduce the risk of infection.\n<b>Apply a bandage:</b> Cover the wound with a clean bandage to protect it from further irritation.\n<b>Monitor the area:</b> If swelling or unusual symptoms occur, seek medical advice just in case venom was injected but the effects are delayed.\n
    </string>

    <string name="venomous_bite1"><b>Stay calm and still:</b> Movement can spread the venom more quickly through the body. Try to limit activity as much as possible.\n<b>Call emergency services immediately:</b> Venomous bites require professional medical treatment, usually antivenom.\n<b>Keep the bite area below the heart:</b> This helps slow the spread of venom.\n<b>Remove tight clothing and jewelry:</b> As swelling may occur, remove anything that could become constricting.\n<b>Immobilize the affected area:</b> Use a splint to keep the limb still if the bite is on a leg or arm.\n<b>Apply a clean bandage:</b> Place a loose bandage over the bite but avoid using a tourniquet, as it can restrict blood flow and cause further damage.\n<b>Do not suck out the venom:</b> This outdated method can cause more harm than good and isn’t effective.\n
    </string>

    <string name="sprain">A sprain is an injury to a ligament, which is the tissue that connects two bones in a joint. Sprains occur when a ligament is stretched or torn due to excessive force, such as twisting, falling, or an impact to the joint. The most common locations for sprains are the ankles, knees, wrists, and thumbs. There are levels of severity sprain has:
    </string>

    <string name="grade_1_sprain">A Grade 1 sprain is the least severe form of a sprain, involving a slight overstretching or microscopic tearing of the ligament. The ligament remains intact, but it has been stretched beyond its normal range of motion.
    </string>

    <string name="grade_1_sprain_symptoms">■Mild pain\n■Swelling\n■Stiffness around the joint, but typically no instability. You can still bear weight on the joint, but it may be slightly uncomfortable.
    </string>

    <string name="grade_2_sprain">A Grade 2 sprain is more serious and involves a partial tear of the ligament. The fibers of the ligament are damaged but not completely torn, which results in some loss of joint function and stability.
    </string>

    <string name="grade_2_sprain_symptoms">■Moderate to significant pain\n■Swelling\n■Bruising around the joint. \n■Joint mobility may be restricted, and the person may feel some instability or difficulty bearing weight on the joint.
    </string>

    <string name="grade_3_sprain">A Grade 3 sprain is the most severe type, involving a complete tear or rupture of the ligament. The ligament no longer provides any stability to the joint, and the joint may feel completely unstable or non-functional.
    </string>

    <string name="grade_3_sprain_symptoms">■Severe pain (though sometimes less painful if the ligament is completely torn)
        \n■Significant swelling
        \n■Bruising
        \n■Total loss of joint function (The person is typically unable to bear any weight on the joint, and the joint feels very unstable).
    </string>

    <string name="grade_1_sprain1"><b>Rest:</b> Avoid activities that may strain the joint for a few days to allow healing.\n<b>Ice:</b> Apply ice to the affected area for 15-20 minutes every 1-2 hours for the first 48 hours to reduce swelling and pain.\n<b>Compression:</b> Use an elastic bandage to wrap the injured joint to limit swelling but not too tight as to cut off circulation.\n<b>Elevation:</b> Keep the injured joint elevated above heart level as much as possible to reduce swelling.\n<b>Over-the-counter pain relief:</b> You can take ibuprofen or acetaminophen to manage pain and swelling.\n<b>Gentle exercise:</b> After a few days, start gentle movement exercises to prevent stiffness, but avoid anything that causes pain.\n
    </string>

    <string name="grade_2_sprain1"><b>Rest:</b> Avoid activities that may strain the joint for a few days to allow healing.\n<b>Ice:</b> Apply ice to the affected area for 15-20 minutes every 1-2 hours for the first 48 hours to reduce swelling and pain.\n<b>Compression:</b> Use an elastic bandage to wrap the injured joint to limit swelling but not too tight as to cut off circulation.\n<b>Elevation:</b> Keep the injured joint elevated above heart level as much as possible to reduce swelling.\n<b>Immobilization:</b> The joint may need to be immobilized with a brace or splint for support while healing.\n<b>Physical Therapy:</b> Once the pain and swelling have subsided, guided physical therapy may be necessary to restore mobility, strength, and stability to the joint.\n<b>Pain management:</b> Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help with pain and swelling.\n<b>Recovery time:</b> A moderate sprain may take several weeks (4-6 weeks) to fully heal.\n
    </string>

    <string name="grade_3_sprain1"><b>Immediate medical attention:</b> A severe sprain often requires professional medical care, including diagnostic imaging like an X-ray or MRI to assess ligament damage.\n<b>Immobilization or surgery:</b> The joint may need to be immobilized for a longer period, and in some cases, surgery may be required to repair torn ligaments.\n<b>Rehabilitation:</b> Physical therapy will be critical to restoring full function, which may take several months.\n<b>Avoid weight-bearing activities:</b> Use crutches or other mobility aids to avoid putting weight on the injured joint.\n<b>Long-term management:</b> Even after healing, ongoing exercises to strengthen the joint and maintain flexibility may be necessary to prevent future injuries.\n
    </string>

    <string name="sprain1">Each grade requires different levels of care and recovery. While Grade 1 sprains often heal with simple first aid, Grade 2 and 3 sprains may need medical intervention and rehabilitation to ensure proper recovery.
    </string>

    <string name="nose_bleed">A nosebleed is the loss of blood from the tissue lining inside the nose. It can happen when the tiny blood vessels in the nose are broken due to trauma, irritation, dry air, or other causes. Nosebleeds are common and generally not serious.
    </string>

    <string name="nose_bleed1"><b>Stay calm:</b> Keep yourself or the person calm to avoid raising blood pressure, which can worsen the bleeding.\n<b>Sit upright and lean forward:</b> This helps prevent swallowing blood, which can irritate the stomach or cause choking. Leaning forward allows the blood to drain out of the nose.\n<b>Pinch the nose:</b> Using your thumb and index finger, pinch the soft part of the nose just below the nasal bridge. Hold it for about 10-15 minutes without interruption.\n<b>Breathe through the mouth:</b> Continue breathing through your mouth while pinching the nose.\n<b>Cold compress:</b> Apply a cold compress to the bridge of the nose to constrict blood vessels and help slow the bleeding.\n<b>Avoid blowing your nose:</b> Once the bleeding stops, avoid blowing or picking your nose, as this could restart the bleeding.\n

    <string name="musclecramps">Muscle cramps are sudden, involuntary contractions or spasms in one or more muscles, usually causing sharp pain. They often occur in the legs, particularly the calf muscles, but can also affect other parts of the body, like the hands, feet, and arms. Muscle cramps can last from a few seconds to several minutes and are common during exercise or at night.
    </string>

    <string name="cause_musclecramps"><b>Dehydration:</b> Loss of fluids and electrolytes (like sodium, potassium, or magnesium) can cause cramping.\n<b>Overuse of muscles:</b> Strenuous exercise, especially if muscles aren\'t used to the intensity, can trigger cramps.\n<b>Poor circulation:</b> Reduced blood flow to muscles can cause cramps, especially during exercise.\n<b>Holding a position for too long:</b> Staying in one position, such as sitting or standing, can lead to cramps.\n<b>Nutrient deficiencies:</b> Lack of essential minerals like potassium, calcium, or magnesium can cause cramping.\n
    </string>

    <string name="musclecramps1"><b>Gentle stretching:</b> Slowly stretch the affected muscle. For example, if your calf muscle is cramping, flex your foot and stretch the calf by pulling your toes toward you.\n<b>Massage:</b> Gently rub or knead the cramped muscle to help relax it.\n<b>Apply Heat:</b> Apply a warm towel, heating pad, or take a warm bath to relax tight muscles.\n<b>Apply some Cold:</b> Use an ice pack on the affected muscle if it remains sore after the cramp subsides.\n<b>Hydrate:</b> Drink water or an electrolyte-rich sports drink to replenish fluids and minerals lost due to dehydration.\n<b>Walk or Move:</b> Walking around or gently moving the affected area can increase blood circulation, helping relieve the cramp.\n<b>Pain Relief:</b> If the muscle remains sore after the cramp, over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen may help reduce the discomfort.\n

    </string>

    <string name="blister">A blister is a small pocket of fluid that forms on the upper layers of the skin, typically due to friction, heat, or chemical exposure. Blisters act as a protective barrier, allowing the skin underneath to heal. The fluid inside is usually clear, but in some cases, it can contain blood if small blood vessels are damaged, or pus if the blister becomes infected. </string>

    <string name="blister_cause"><b>Friction:</b> Repeated rubbing of the skin, such as from poorly fitting shoes, can cause friction blisters.\n<b>Burns:</b> Exposure to heat, including sunburns, can lead to the formation of blisters.\n<b>Chemical Exposure:</b> Certain irritants or chemicals can cause blisters when they come into contact with the skin.\n<b>Medical Conditions:</b> Some conditions, like chickenpox or eczema, can cause blisters as part of their symptoms.\n
    </string>

    <string name="blister1"><b>Leave the blister intact:</b> If the blister is small and not too painful, it is best to leave it alone. The blister acts as a natural barrier to infection, and the fluid inside promotes healing. Cover it with a clean, loose bandage or blister pad to protect it from further friction.\n<b>Do not pop the blister:</b> Popping a blister can increase the risk of infection. If the blister is large, painful, or in a location where it’s likely to burst, you can consult a healthcare professional for advice.\n<b>Clean the area:</b> If the blister bursts, wash the area with soap and water to reduce the risk of infection. Gently pat the area dry and apply an antibiotic ointment to protect the skin.\n<b>Cover with a bandage:</b> Use a sterile bandage or blister pad to protect the area. Change the bandage daily or if it becomes wet or dirty.\n<b>Pain relief:</b> Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen can help reduce pain and inflammation associated with a blister.\n<b>Watch for infection:</b> Signs of infection include redness, warmth, increased pain, and yellow or green discharge. If these symptoms occur, seek medical attention.\n

    <string name="blister2">Blisters usually heal on their own in a few days, but proper care can help speed recovery and prevent complications.
    </string>

    <string name="bruise">A bruise occurs when small blood vessels under the skin break due to an impact or injury, causing blood to leak into the surrounding tissue. This leads to the characteristic black, blue, or purple discoloration of the skin. Over time, the body reabsorbs the blood, and the bruise gradually fades, changing colors as it heals.
    </string>

    <string name="bruise1"><b>Rest and protect the injured area:</b> Minimize use of the injured area to prevent further trauma and allow the tissue to heal.\n<b>Ice the bruise:</b> Apply an ice pack (wrapped in a cloth) to the bruised area for 10-20 minutes. This helps reduce swelling and limits the size of the bruise by constricting blood vessels and slowing blood flow to the area. Do not apply ice directly to the skin, as this can cause frostbite.\n<b>Elevate the bruised area:</b> If possible, elevate the bruised area above heart level to reduce blood flow and limit swelling.\n<b>Compression:</b> Lightly wrap the bruised area with a bandage to provide mild compression, which can help reduce swelling. Make sure not to wrap it too tightly, as it may impair circulation.\n<b>Pain relief:</b> Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen can help alleviate discomfort. Avoid NSAIDs like ibuprofen or aspirin shortly after the injury, as they may increase bleeding.\n<b>Monitor the bruise:</b> Most bruises heal on their own in about 1-2 weeks. However, if a bruise is unusually large, very painful, or doesn’t improve, consult a healthcare provider. Bruising easily or without a known cause could also indicate an underlying medical issue.\n
    </string>

    <string name="bruise2">Bruises are usually harmless, but paying attention to their healing and treating them with care can help reduce discomfort and promote faster recovery.
    </string>

    <string name="allergic_reaction">An allergic reaction occurs when the immune system mistakenly identifies a harmless substance (an allergen) as harmful and overreacts to it. Common allergens include pollen, food, insect stings, pet dander, medications, and latex. The reaction can range from mild to severe and can affect different parts of the body, such as the skin, respiratory system, and digestive system.
    </string>

    <string name="mild_symptoms">■Sneezing, runny or stuffy nose\n■Itchy or watery eyes\n■Rash, hives (raised, itchy welts on the skin)\nMild swelling, usually localized\n■Coughing, wheezing\n

    </string>

    <string name="mild_symptoms1"><b>Antihistamines:</b> Over-the-counter antihistamines (like diphenhydramine or loratadine) can help reduce itching, sneezing, and swelling.\n<b>Cold compresses:</b> Apply a cool, damp cloth to rashes or areas with swelling to reduce irritation.\n<b>Avoid the allergen:</b> Once you identify what caused the reaction (e.g., a specific food or pollen), avoid exposure to the allergen in the future.\n<b>Topical creams:</b> Hydrocortisone creams or calamine lotion can help soothe itching and skin irritation.\n
    </string>

    <string name="severe_symptoms1"><b>Administer an epinephrine auto-injector (e.g., EpiPen):</b> If you have been prescribed an epinephrine auto-injector, use it immediately at the first sign of a severe allergic reaction.\n<b>Call emergency services:</b> Dial emergency medical services immediately after administering epinephrine or if severe symptoms arise.\n
    </string>

    <string name="severe_symptoms2"><b>Positioning:</b> Keep the person lying down with their legs elevated unless they are having difficulty breathing, in which case they should be sitting upright.\n<b>Monitor breathing:</b> If breathing stops or the person becomes unconscious, perform CPR if you are trained until medical help arrives.\n
    </string>

    <string name="allergic_reaction2">It’s important to consult with a healthcare provider if you suspect allergies or experience frequent allergic reactions. In severe cases, a professional diagnosis and prescription medications may be necessary to manage the condition safely.
    </string>

    <string name="strain">A Strain is an injury to a muscle or tendon (the tissue that connects muscles to bones), usually caused by overstretching or tearing due to excessive force or overuse. Strains commonly occur in areas like the back, hamstrings, or shoulders and can happen during physical activities like lifting heavy objects, sports, or even sudden movements.
    </string>

    <string name="strain_symptoms">"■Pain and tenderness in the affected muscle or tendon
■Swelling, bruising, or redness
■Muscle weakness or difficulty moving the affected area
■Muscle spasms or cramping      "</string>

    <string name="strain1"><b>Rest:</b> Avoid using the injured area to prevent further damage. Give the muscle or tendon time to heal by reducing activity, especially in the first 48 hours after the injury.\n<b>Ice:</b> Apply ice to the strained area for 15-20 minutes every 1-2 hours for the first 48 hours. This helps reduce swelling and numbs the pain. Use a cold pack or ice wrapped in a cloth to avoid direct contact with the skin.\n<b>Compression:</b> Wrap the injured area with an elastic bandage (like an Ace wrap) to limit swelling. Make sure the wrap is snug but not so tight that it restricts blood flow.\n<b>Elevation:</b> If possible, elevate the injured area above heart level to reduce swelling and inflammation. For example, if the strain is in your leg, prop it up on pillows.\n<b>Over-the-counter pain relief:</b> Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen or aspirin, can help reduce pain and inflammation.\n<b>Gentle stretching and physical therapy:</b> After the initial inflammation subsides, gentle stretching and strengthening exercises may help restore muscle function. Consult a healthcare provider or physical therapist to ensure you are doing the appropriate exercises for your recovery.\n<b>Avoid strenuous activity:</b> Do not rush back into full activity too soon, as this can delay healing and lead to re-injury. Gradually return to your usual activities as the strain heals.\n
    </string>

    <string name="strain2">Strains typically heal with rest and proper care, but more severe strains may require medical evaluation or even physical therapy to recover fully.
    </string>

    <string name="splints">A splint is a supportive device used to keep in place any suspected fracture in one’s arm or leg.\n
        \n<b>Splint is used to:</b>\n
        \n■Provide pain relief of the fractured limb.
        \n■Support bone ends of the fracture site. Bones ends of the fracture site are very sharp. A splint helps prevent bone protruding through the skin, soft skin and tissue damage, as well as bleeding.
        \n■Facilitate safe and seamless causality transport.\n
        \n<b>Types of Splints</b>:\n
        \n■<b>Rigid Splint:</b> Any rigid object, such as wood or plastic boards, broomstick, book or a rolled-out newspapers, which can be used to splint a fractured arm or leg.
        \n■<b>Flexible Splint:</b> Any flexible object, like a pillow or a bed sheet with several folds. This type is used for foot, ankle and joint fractures.

    <string name="splints1">Here are some general principles to be applied when splinting as follows:
    </string>

    <string name="splints2">■Identify the fracture site.
    </string>

    <string name="splints3">■Stop the bleeding using bandages, but avoid pressing on the fractured painful and deformed site.
    </string>

    <string name="splints4">■In case of bone fractures where bone ends protrude through the skin, do not push these ends back in place as this will cause inflammation and acute bleeding.
    </string>

    <string name="splints5">■Keep the fractured bone (including the joints above and below the fracture site) motionless as indicated here under:
\n1. If the lower-arm is fractured, keep the wrist and elbow joints motionless.
\n2. If the upper-arm is fractured, keep the shoulder and elbow joints motionless.
\n3. If the lower-leg is fractured, keep the knee and ankle joints motionless.
\n4. If the upper-leg is fractured, keep the knee and femoral joints motionless.
    </string>

    <string name="splints6">■If the fractured limb is bent with a sharp bone end protruding through the skin, keep it motionless. Splint a limb as you find it to make it as comfortable to the patient as you possible.
    </string>

    <string name="splints7">■If an ambulance is called and is on its way, do not splint the fractured limb and wait for the ambulance team to use their specialized medical splints.
    </string>

    <string name="insectbite1">An insect bite or sting occurs when an insect either bites to feed on blood (e.g., mosquitoes) or stings as a defense mechanism (e.g., bees or wasps).

    <string name="first_db">First-degree burns damage the outer layer of your skin, better known as the epidermis. Typically, these burns heal themselves within a week. A good example of a first-degree burn would be sunburn. So, don\’t forget your tanning lotion.
    </string>

    <string name="second_db">Second-degree burns damage both the outer layer and the layer beneath it, which is called the dermis. With these burns, a skin graft is sometimes needed. A skin graft is essentially a procedure in which healthy skin is transplanted to cover the burn, allowing it to heal.
    </string>

    <string name="third_db">Third-degree burns are more severe, as they destroy both layers of your skin. Hair follicles, sweat glands, and other tissues tend to result in damage as well. Remember those skin-grafts we talked about? They are always required with third-degree burns.
    </string>

    <string name="burn1">Stop the burning process as soon as possible. This may mean removing the person from the area, dousing flames with water, or smothering flames with a blanket. Do not put yourself at risk of getting burnt as well.
    </string>

    <string name="burn2">Remove any clothing or jewellery near the burnt area of skin, including babies\' nappies. But do not try to remove anything that is stuck to the burnt skin, as this could cause more damage.
    </string>

    <string name="burn3">Cool the burn with cool or lukewarm running water for 20 minutes as soon as possible after the injury. Never use ice, iced water, or any creams or greasy substances like butter.
    </string>

    <string name="burn4">Keep yourself or the person warm. Use a blanket or layers of clothing, but avoid putting them on the injured area. Keeping warm will prevent hypothermia, where a person\'s body temperature drops below 35C (95F). This is a risk if you\'re cooling a large burnt area, particularly in young children and elderly people.
    </string>

    <string name="burn5">Cover the burn with cling film. Lay the cling film over the burn, rather than wrapping it around a limb. A clean, clear plastic bag can be used for burns on your hand.
    </string>

    <string name="burn6">Treat the pain from a burn with paracetamol or ibuprofen. Always check the manufacturer\'s instructions when using over-the-counter medication. Children under 16 years of age should not be given aspirin. Raise the affected area, if possible. This will help to reduce swelling.
    </string>

    <string name="choking1">Step 1: If someone is choking, encourage them to cough.
    </string>

    <string name="choking2">If the blockage is severe, they may be holding their chest or neck and won\'t be able to speak, breathe or cough, and you will need to help them.
    </string>

    <string name="choking3">Step 2: Bend them forwards and give up to 5 back blows to try and dislodge the blockage.
    </string>

    <string name="choking4">Hit them firmly on their back with the heel of your hand between the shoulder blades.
    </string>

    <string name="choking5">Step 3: If they are still choking, give up to 5 abdominal thrusts.
    </string>

    <string name="choking6">Hold around the waist and pull inwards and upwards above their belly button.
    </string>

    <string name="choking7">Step 4: If they are still choking call your Local Hotline.
    </string>

    <string name="choking8">Repeat the steps until they can breathe again or until help arrives.
    </string>

    <string name="choking9">Step 1: Give up to five back blows
    </string>

    <string name="choking10">Hold the baby face-down along your thigh with their head lower than their bottom. Hit them firmly on their back between the shoulder blades up to five times. If back blows do not dislodge the blockage, move on to step 2.
    </string>

    <string name="choking11">Step 2: Give up to five chest thrusts.
    </string>

    <string name="choking12">Turn the baby over so they are facing upwards. Place two fingers in the middle of their chest just below the nipples. Push sharply downwards up to five times.
    </string>

    <string name="choking13">Step 3: Call the hotline if the blockage does not dislodge.
    </string>

    <string name="choking14">Continue with cycles of back blows and chest thrusts until the blockage dislodges, help arrives or the baby becomes unresponsive. If you can’t call your local hotline; get someone else to do it.
    </string>

    <string name="cpr">CPR: Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation is an emergency lifesaving procedure performed when the heart stops beating. Immediate CPR can double or triple chances of survival after cardiac arrest.
    </string>

    <string name="cpr1">Step 1.Call an Ambulance (Dial your Local Hotline)
    </string>

    <string name="cpr2">Step 2.Place the person on their back and open their airway
    </string>

    <string name="cpr3">Place the person carefully on their back and kneel beside their chest. Tilt their head back slightly by lifting their chin. Open their mouth and check for any obstruction, such as food or vomit. Remove any obstruction if it is loose. If it is not loose, trying to grasp it may push it farther into the airway.
    </string>

    <string name="cpr4">Step 3.Check for breathing
    </string>

    <string name="cpr5">Place your ear next to the person’s mouth and listen for no more than 10 seconds. If you do not hear breathing, or you only hear occasional gasps, begin CPR. If someone is unconscious but still breathing, do not perform CPR. Instead, if they do not seem to have a spinal injury, place them in the recovery position. Keep monitoring their breathing and perform CPR if they stop breathing.
    </string>

    <string name="cpr6">Step 4.Perform chest compressions 30 times
    </string>

    <string name="cpr7">Place one of your hands on top of the other and clasp them together. With the heel of the hands and straight elbows, push hard and fast in the center of the chest, slightly below the nipples. Push at least 2 inches deep. Compress their chest at a rate of least 100 times per minute. Let the chest rise fully between compressions.
    </string>

    <string name="cpr8">Step 5.Perform two rescue breaths
    </string>

    <string name="cpr9">Making sure their mouth is clear, tilt their head back slightly and lift their chin. Pinch their nose shut, place your mouth fully over theirs, and blow to make their chest rise. If their chest does not rise with the first breath, retilt their head. If their chest still does not rise with a second breath, the person might be choking. Repeat above steps till an ambulance arrives.
    </string>

    <string name="shock">If you suspect someone has received an electric shock you must ensure all power sources are isolated before you can treat the casualty. The action you take will depend on whether the risk is posed by high voltage or low voltage electricity.\n
\n<b>■High Voltage</b>\nOverhead power cables are an example of a power source generating high voltage electricity. High voltage electricity has the ability to jump or arc up to distances of 18 metres or more. If faced with a casualty as a result of, or in the vicinity of, dangerous high voltage electricity, DO NOT APPROACH! Stay at least 25 metres away from the casualty until the power has been switched off by an official agency i.e. the Electricity Board.
\n\n<b>■Low Voltage</b>\nIf faced with a casualty who is in the process of receiving a low voltage electric shock you should:
Act to break the contact between the casualty and the electrical supply. If possible to do so safely, you should turn off the source of electricity, either by switching off the current at the mains, turning the power off at the circuit board, removing the plug or wrenching the cable free.\n\nAlternatively, move the source of the shock (i.e. hairdryer, power tool) away from yourself and the casualty using an object of low conductivity. First, stand on a dry insulating material, such as a book, newspapers or rubber matting. Then, use a long, low-conductivity object like a wooden broom or specially designed Electric Shock Rescue Hook to push the power source away from the casualty or move the casualty\'s limbs away from the power source.
    </string>

    <string name="shock1"><b>■DO NOT TOUCH</b> the casualty if you have been unable to isolate them from the source of the electrical shock or turn off the electricity
    </string>

    <string name="shock2">■Casualty is Responsive
    </string>

    <string name="shock3">1. Ask hello, can you hear me? and call their name if you know it.\n2. Ask in both the casualty\'s ears for them to open their eyes.\n3. Pinch an ear lobe or tap the shoulders.\n4. Shout for HELP!\n5. DO NOT move the casualty unless the environment or situation is dangerous.\nCall emergency services now.
    </string>

    <string name="shock4">■Unresponsive but breathing
    </string>

    <string name="shock5">If the casualty is unresponsive and breathing normally, turn the casualty to the recovery position. This allows the head to be tilted back and down, stopping the tongue from blocking the airway and allowing any vomit or fluid to drain safely from the mouth.\n\n1. Check for any other obvious injuries and call emergency services\n2. Remove sharp objects from casualty\'s pockets\n3. Turn the casualty into the recovery position as follows:\n4. Place the nearest arm at a right angle to the body\n5. Draw the furthest arm across the chest and place the back of the hand across the cheek nearest to you\n6. Keep this here whilst you raise the furthest leg by grasping the top of the knee\n7. Gently pull on the knee so the casualty pivots over onto their side facing you\n8. The casualty should be fully onto their side and stable\n9. Adjust the upper leg so the hip and the knee are bent at right angles\n10. Re-check the airway, breathing and circulation. Ensure the airway is open\n11. Check for continued breathing.
    </string>

    <string name="shock6">■Unresponsive and NOT breathing
    </string>

    <string name="shock7">Begin CPR with chest compressions as soon as possible. Do not leave the casualty to search for an AED.\nWhen phoning emergency services, DO NOT hang up at any stage of the conversation. The operator will terminate the call when appropriate. You should determine responsiveness and whether the casualty is breathing before speaking to the emergency services because this enables them to assign the appropriate priority to your situation.
    </string>

    <string name="shock8">■BURNS
    </string>

    <string name="shock9">■Exposure to electricity can cause burns to the skin, and in severe cases, the internal organs. The electricity may cause entry and exit burns - for example, entering via a hand and leaving via the feet.\n\n■For responsive casualties:\nCool burns for a minimum of 10 minutes under cold water\n\n■For unresponsive casualties:\nCool the burn with wet dressings (or special burn dressings) after placing them in the recovery position.\n\n<b>■DO NOT</b>\n1.Burst any blisters\n2.Apply adhesive dressings\n3.Remove damaged skin\n4.Apply ointments/creams\n5.Cover with fluffy dressings\n6.Affix dressings too tightly\n7.Apply butter/fats/margarine or other substances commonly believed to cool burns\n8.Remove damaged clothing\n9.Apply ice
